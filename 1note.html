            <h3>What is GitHub</h3>
            <p>If GitHub was a duo run Instagram meme account then:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the account was run based of people sending memes to post (community run account) then the DMs would be a “pull request” because you don’t want to give people the account password. The code and the account is still your Intellectual Property (IP) so you are creating a buffer, no one can post prank codes on git, and nobody can steal your insta account and lock you out.                     
                </li>
        
                <li>The insta accounnt still belonged to one person(through email and phone numbers), and they shared the password through an agreement with the second person, in GitHub there is a “project” option. This allows you to create a project (which me and you are going to do for the candle business) in this project you have a main branch where the original code is posted, I can then go make my own branch to make my changes and keep it separate to avoid confusions, I don't need a “pull request” to make a change. You can design hierarchies in the “project” and authority of the project comes down to the owner. “project” are temporary though and they apply to a specific website, game or app. 
                </li>
  
                <li>“organizations” are a permanent thing, you can create projects within an organization and those projects are controlled by the organization. Once again whoever creates the organization has the final say in the organization. What that means in insta terms is if you and your friend had a falling out and you started the organization, they have to take you to court for it, they can’t change the e-mail and the phone number to lock you out. 
                </li>
                     
            </ul>
            
            <p>GitHub is a great platform which can do a lot of tasks- website hosting, team management it’s also the google drive/OneDrive to keep an insurance in case your PC breaks.
                The problem with having too much in our one place is it becomes confusing for people to use however it keeps the platform free from people who have no business there in the first place (forex traders, Scams).
                Its strictly code.
