            <h3>Team Collaborations</h3>
            <p>You can make your code completely open-source meaning its free for the entire world to go on GitHub and see how you built a website or application and this is called a review, you can do reviews privately which is how the lectures are going to grade your work but sometimes people also visit and they encounter problems (issues, bugs, other slang but those 2 are common) they can if they want to make changes and correct your code so it can function but it wonâ€™t reflect on your website. They must make a pull request, meaning you must review the changes they made before it reflects on your code (main branch).
