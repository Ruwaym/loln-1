            <h3>Repository&#40;Repo&#41;</h3>
            <p>Itâ€™s just a specific folder on your computer in the files folder. The point of it is when you want to make a website public or you want to put it on github for different people to work on, then you copy and paste your text files (index.html, style.css, etc) in that specific folder. You can customize that name of that folder nut usually the folder is labelled my project.
